# Linear Regression Hyperparameter Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a **Streamlit dashboard** for experimenting with **Linear Regression** and its hyperparameters.  
You can **upload your dataset**, train a model, and check the performance metrics like:

- **Training Accuracy / R² Score**
- **Testing Accuracy / R² Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

The dashboard also helps you understand if your model is:

- **Overfitting** – High training accuracy but low test accuracy  
- **Underfitting** – Low training and test accuracy  
- **Good fit** – Training and test accuracy are both high and similar

---

## Features

1. **Upload Dataset**  
   Upload your CSV file containing features and target variable.

2. **Train Linear Regression Model**  
   Adjust hyperparameters and train the model on your dataset.

3. **View Performance Metrics**  
   - Training and Testing R²  
   - MSE  
   - Model evaluation (Overfit / Underfit / Good fit)

4. **Interactive Dashboard**  
   Streamlit interface for easy interaction and visualization.
